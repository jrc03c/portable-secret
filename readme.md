# Portable Secret

This project was inspired by [mprimi/portable-secret](https://github.com/mprimi/portable-secret). In fact, it does basically the same thing, but I wanted to make my own version so that I could feel relatively confident that I knew what was happening at every step.

Note that this is built on top of my [@jrc03c/js-crypto-helpers](https://github.com/jrc03c/js-crypto-helpers) library. Please read the documentation there for more info about what's going on under the hood.
